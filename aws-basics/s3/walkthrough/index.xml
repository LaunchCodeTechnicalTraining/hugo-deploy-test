Bucket Name: This name must be unique. If there is an existing bucket with the desired name you will not be able to create the bucket. Object Ownership: Public Access: Public access is blocked by default. This behavior can be changed. Bucket Versioning: Encryption: Bucket Name For your first bucket you will only need to provide a unique name and leave all other options as they have been defaulted.</description></item><item><title>Accessing Your S3 Bucket</title><link>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/aws-basics/s3/walkthrough/accessing-s3-bucket/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 13:43:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/aws-basics/s3/walkthrough/accessing-s3-bucket/</guid><description>Accessing Your New S3 Bucket Now that you have created an S3 Bucket, you will want to access the resource.
S3 Bucket Dashboard Navigate to the Amazon S3 Dashboard to view your existing buckets.
Click on the name of your newly created bucket. The bucket I created is named my-first-bucket-john.
Note This AWS Account also has an already existing bucket named launchcode-blog-images. You will only see the bucket you created in the previous walkthrough unless you have explored and utilized the S3 resource in the past!</description></item></channel></rss>
