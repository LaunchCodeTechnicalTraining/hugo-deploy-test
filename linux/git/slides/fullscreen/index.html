## Git
---
## Git Review
Version Control Software created by Linux Torvalds
Similar to the Linux Kernel (also created by Torvalds) it is open source software
___
## Basic Workflow
Adding changes to staging
Committing changes to local git repo
Pushing changes from local repo to remote
___
### Creating a Local Repo
git init (within project directory) will initialize a git repository in your current directory
This allows you to begin controlling "versions" of your project
---
## Branches
Branches allow you to diverge from your master or main branch of development
You are able to create a new branch in multiple ways:
git branch new-branch-name
git checkout -b new-branch-name
---
## Merging
This course will cover two different types of merging strategies
Traditional merge with git merge
merging with git rebase
___
### Traditional Merge
Using the traditional merge strategy allows you to keep the original history of commits in-tact
It also means that you will be working directly on your main or master branch of development
___
### Git Rebase
git rebase will reapply commits from your current branch on top of the target branch
You are working with a feature branch and conflits are handled prior to merging directly into your main or master branch of development
A rebase does alter the history of the feature branch
