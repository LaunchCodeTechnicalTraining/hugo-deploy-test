Navigate your terminal to the py-demo-web-logs project you cloned in the previous walkthrough.
Run the command git branch.
Running the git branch command without an argument will show you the current branch you are working on and any additional local branches in your local repository (this project only has one branch in the local repository).</description></item><item><title>Changing Branches</title><link>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/git/walkthrough/git-branching/changing-branches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/git/walkthrough/git-branching/changing-branches/</guid><description>Changing Branches Now that you have a new branch to work with you can switch or checkout the branch by using the git checkout command.
Run the command git checkout bug-fix.
Once more check your current branch status with the git branch command.
Running the Python Program Run the main.py program within py-demo-web-logs to view the output:
You will notice that the current output has the following issues:
ip: /home/student home-dir: 127.</description></item><item><title>Staging Changes</title><link>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/git/walkthrough/git-branching/staging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/git/walkthrough/git-branching/staging/</guid><description>Staging, Committing &amp;amp; Pushing Now that you have made changes on a new branch this would be a great place to stage, commit and push the changes. You can then open a new pull request so the changes introduced in the bug-fix branch can be incorporated into the master branch.
git status: Check that there have been changes made git add . or git add [file-name]: Add the changes to staging git commit -m &amp;quot;commit message&amp;quot;: Commit the changes git push origin bug-fix: Push updated local branch to remote repo Submit a pull request and merge the bug-fix branch into the master branch.</description></item><item><title>Best Practices</title><link>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/git/walkthrough/git-branching/branching-practices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/git/walkthrough/git-branching/branching-practices/</guid><description>Branching Practices When creating a new branch you always want to make sure your master branch is updated to the most recent version. One reason for this is to avoid any unecessary merge conflicts when you begin to merge any working branches into the master branch. That process will look something like the following:
git checkout master (if not already on the master branch) git pull: Update master branch to most recent working version git branch [new-branch-name]: Create a new branch git checkout [new-branch-name]: Checkout or switch to newly created branch Note When you &amp;ldquo;checkout&amp;rdquo; from master you are effectively creating a new branch with identical files and directories to the master branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
