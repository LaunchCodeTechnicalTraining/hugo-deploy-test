We didn&amp;rsquo;t cover git revert, however it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool.
Git revert git-revert - Revert some existing commits
Git revert will allow us to undo a commit.
Say for example you accidentally deleted some important directories in your local repository, you then committed the changes, and pushed them to your remote repository.
Now both your local and remote repositories are missing the files in the directories you deleted!</description></item></channel></rss>
