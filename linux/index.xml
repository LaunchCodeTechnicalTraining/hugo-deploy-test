In order to use Linux we will need to install Linux on to our computers.
In lieu of overwriting our preferred operating systems we will be using VirtualBox to create a virtual operating system inside of our host operating system. This is possible by partitioning a portion of our hard drive to hold a full-fledged operating system, a concept known as virtualization.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 15:11:04 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/introduction/</guid><description>Note The slides found at this location are meant to be used in personal reference.

terminal bash bash streams, redirection &amp;amp; pipes Linux file system &amp;amp; permissions package manager version control bash scripting cron web servers systemd additional user space applications At this point multiple web projects have been deployed to your Linux machine.
Going through the concepts and practicing is how you will become comfortable with the concepts and skills in this course.
For your final project you will be required to create two initialization scripts.</description></item><item><title>Quality of Life Improvements</title><link>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/quality-of-life/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 10:20:03 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/quality-of-life/</guid><description>Content Links Quality of Life Improvement Articles</description></item><item><title>Contributing to this Project</title><link>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/contributing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 11:15:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/contributing/</guid><description>Ways to Contribute Suggest a Change to a Page Creating a GitHub Issue</description></item></channel></rss>
