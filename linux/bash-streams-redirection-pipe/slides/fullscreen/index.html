## Bash: Streams, Redirection & Pipes
---
## Types of Streams
STDIN: Standard Input - 0 (file descriptor)
STDOUT: Standard Output - 1 (file descriptor)
STDERR: Standard Error - 2 (file descriptor)
___
### Standard Input
All Bash command are a form of STDIN
___
### Standard Output
STDOUT is always displayed inside of the terminal window by default
Should you ever wish for STDOUT not to be displayed this can be accomplished in different ways
Sometimes a command allows -s as a "silent" option
You can also redirect the stream into an alternate location
___
### Standard Error
Similar to STDOUT, STDERR is also displayed inside of the terminal window by default
STDERR is commonly the result of an incorrect bash command, incorrect arguments, or incorrect options provided
---
## Redirection
Redirect Write >
Redirect Append >>
___
### Redirect Write with STDOUT
The > operator is used to redirect STDOUT and write to a new location
Using the redirect write option will **overwrite** the contents of the target location
Redirecting the STDOUT will also prevent the STDOUT of the command to be displayed inside of the terminal window
___
### Redirect Append with STDOUT
The >> operator is used to redirect STDOUT and append to a provided location
Using the redirect append option will **append** the contents of the target location
This means that the STDOUT will be added to a given file in addition to what is already inside
As mentioned in the previous slide this will also prevent the STDOUT from being displayed inside of the terminal window
___
### Redirect STDERR
STDERR can also be redirected using its file descriptor
To write STDERR to a new location you would use 2>
To append STDERR to a new location you would use 2>>
---
## Pipes
The Bash pipe operator | allows the user to take STDOUT from the first command and use it as STDIN for the next
Piping allows the user to chain multiple commands together for more complex commands
