### Use Cases
This course utilizes Caddy and NGINX to server static files as web applications for the following:
- React Project
- Spring Boot Project
- Angular Project
- C# Project
- Python Project
Caddy - User friendly, less configuration, newer technology (released in 2015)
NGINX - Many organizations still use Nginx (released in 2004)
This Linux Course curriculum is currently being served with a Caddyfile

## Caddy
Requires a Caddyfile to be configured in order to serve web applications
default Caddyfile located at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
Best practice is to store your Caddyfile in the default location
---
## NGINX
Requires a .conf (config) file to be configured in order to server web applications
default .conf file located at /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
Best practice to store any custom .conf files at /etc/nginx/conf.d/
