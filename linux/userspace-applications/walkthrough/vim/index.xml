From the home directory enter:
vim temp-file.txt Upon executing the command a new file named temp-file.txt will be created and the vim text editor will be opened taking over your entire terminal.
Note the file is empty, which makes sense as the file was just created. The file name is listed at the bottom of the terminal window: &amp;quot;temp-file.</description></item><item><title>Normal Mode Command: Writing and Quitting</title><link>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/userspace-applications/walkthrough/vim/command-write-quit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/userspace-applications/walkthrough/vim/command-write-quit/</guid><description>Writing and Quitting Note When entering commands like :w and :q into vim through normal mode you are technically in Command Line Mode. The only way to access Command Line Mode is through Normal mode which is what allows you to enter commands via the Command Line.
vim commands can be sent while in normal mode. This article will cover the write and quit commands.

Open the file created in the last article by entering: vim temp-file.txt
Note Opening a file looks very similar to creating a new file. The only difference in this image from the image in the original creation article is the text at the bottom of the file:

When opening a file, vim defaults to Normal mode.
In Normal mode commands can be given to vim. When content needs to be added the easiest option is to change from Normal mode to Insert mode.
Insert mode will allow us to type directly into the file.
You can enter Insert mode from Normal mode by typing the i key:

Open temp-file.txt
Enter Insert mode by typing i in Normal mode:
In Insert mode type your content:
While in Insert mode your keyboard presses are redirected to the contents of the file.
File Navigation in Insert Mode While in Insert mode the cursor can be controlled with the directional arrow keys on your keyboard.</description></item><item><title>Normal Mode: File Navigation</title><link>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/userspace-applications/walkthrough/vim/normal-navigation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/userspace-applications/walkthrough/vim/normal-navigation/</guid><description>Normal Mode: File Navigation One of vim&amp;rsquo;s major ideals is that the user&amp;rsquo;s hands never need to leave the keyboard. Meaning various keys and keystrokes have been programmed to give the user navigation controls.
Most navigation occurs in Normal mode.
Warning This article will use the user-data.csv used in the previous grep and sed sections. If you do not already have the file, you can re-download it with:

The Normal mode of vim provides a search function that allows you to search for specific characters, words, phrases, or additional Regular Expressions.
To perform a search in vim Normal mode you simply need to press the forward slash (/) character and type in your search term. While typing vim will automatically take you to the first encountered search term from the cursors current location.</description></item><item><title>Next Steps</title><link>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/userspace-applications/walkthrough/vim/next-steps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/linux/userspace-applications/walkthrough/vim/next-steps/</guid><description>Next Steps vim is a powerful text editing tool. We have barely touched the surface on what you can do with this text editor.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more we recommend going through the vimtutor application. It comes standard with the vim package.
Bonus You can access vimtutor from your terminal by entering vimtutor. This will lock your terminal into vimtutor until you exit the package.</description></item></channel></rss>
